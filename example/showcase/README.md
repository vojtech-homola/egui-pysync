# Showcase

Explore values, signals, custom types, collections, numeric buffers, one-shot
transfers, and images. Native and browser GUIs share the same application;
Python and Rust servers provide the same data and actions.

## Run

Install Rust. For the Python server, also install `uv` and run `uv sync` from
the repository root. Run the commands below from `example/showcase`.

Start the Python server (building the GUI generates its bindings):

```sh
cargo build -p showcase_gui
uv run python python/run.py
```

Or start the Rust server, which generates its bindings automatically:

```sh
cargo run -p showcase_server --bin showcase-server
```

In another terminal, from the same directory, start the native GUI:

```sh
cargo run -p showcase_gui --bin showcase-gui
```

Click **Connect** and expand the feature sections to edit values, emit signals,
and explore collection and data controls. Both servers use loopback port
**8091**; run only one at a time. Stop the server with Ctrl+C.

## Browser GUI

Install Trunk, then run from the repository root:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
trunk serve
```

Open [localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090) and click **Connect** while either
showcase server is running.

## Read the code

- [State definitions](gui-core/src/state/mod.rs): follow each feature's module
  for its state handles and custom types.
- [UI rendering](gui-core/src/app.rs): feature controls and client interactions.
- [Python server](python/run.py) / [Rust server](rust/src/lib.rs): callbacks
  and initial data.
- [GUI launcher](gui/main.rs): native and browser entry points.
- [Python binding generation](gui/build.rs) / [Rust binding generation](rust/build.rs):
  both import the state from the shared `gui-core` application library.

After changing the state, rebuild the GUI for Python bindings or the Rust server
for Rust bindings. Generated bindings should not be edited.
